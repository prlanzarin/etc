MAIN MODULES
-> ndn::L3Protocol: implementation of the core NDN
protocol interactions: receiving Interest and Data
packets from upper and lower layers through Faces;

-> ndn::Face: abstraction to enable uniform communications
with applications (ndn::AppFace) and other
simulated nodes (ndn::NetDeviceFace) with pluggable
(and optional) support of link-level congestion
mitigation modules;

-> ndn::ContentStore: abstraction for in-network storage
(e.g., short-term transient, long-term transient,
long-term permanent) for Data packets;

-> ndn::Pit: abstraction for the pending Interest table
(PIT) that keeps track (per-prefix) of Faces on which
Interests were received, Faces to which Interests
were forwarded, as well as previously seen Interest
nonces;

-> ndn::Fib: abstraction for the forwarding information
base (FIB), which can be used to guide Interest
forwarding by the forwarding strategy;

-> ndn::ForwardingStrategy: abstraction and
core implementation for Interest and Data
forwarding. Each step of the forwarding process
in ndn::ForwardingStrategy including lookups
to ContentStore, PIT, FIB, and forwarding Data
packets according to PIT entries is represented
as virtual function calls, which can be overridden
in particular forwarding strategy implementation
classes (see Section 2.7);
